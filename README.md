# # #Happy-Function
# #v1.0.0.0


Peace, mercy and blessings of God...
# this project :
-command-line hybrid program for windows written in dart (I intend later for gui with flutter ,and for other operating systems)
-to give derviative ,partial derviative,napla to any function with steps

# algoritm used:
I used here recursion (and with many functions) to gett the inner most derivative for complex functions
-steps by following changes and add it in FIFO queue

# files at source:
-hapfun:main class
-equationformat :some format to equation before dervative
-driv : most important class for drivative
-hapfunV1:only all classes but for saving exe


# issues unfortantely I had:
1-more than to add functions may case errors or even for complex
2- consts may be showed as the same variable or empty place
3-steps may be unrecognisable especially in napla
4- to get derv of x you may need to write x^1
